# Clock Application Submission

## Future Improvements Document

### 1. iOS/iPad UI Concerns
- Existing Implementation can work for iOS too but in portrait mode only.
- Adaptive UI for portrait/landscape. In order to support portrait and landscape both we need support from UX designer to visualize how the clock can be seen in both modes. based on it UI may change. 

### 2. Nice To have
- UX should be improved. I like to see analog timer.
- I didn't add much helper or extension classes. it would be nice to have some extension classes. like GameObjectExtension.
- Theme the UI.

### 3. VR Considerations (Optional)
- Replace buttons with gaze/controller interactables.  
- 3D Canvas with depth; avoid HUD elements causing motion sickness.  
- Batch UI updates to maintain 90FPS.  

## Development Time Estimate
- Planning: 1 hour  
- Core Implementation: 4 hours  
- Edit and Play mode Tests Implementation : 6 hours (Could able write tests quickly. But to add Moq dll and castle core dlls tooks time. I got conflict and build issues with these two dlls)
- Testing: 2 hours  
- Polish: 1 hours  
- Total: ~14 hours
